# RobotCode2015

This is the repository for the 2015 Robot's various internals.

For now, each folder is one goal, but this will be shifted later so that each folder is the code for each subsystem. This has not been done yet for several reasons, primarily for ease of coding, but also because the flow diagrams for subsystem interaction have not yet been created.
